This project develops a solution based on AI and multiagent systems that is capable of self-healing in a distributed computing environment. The solution is based on the JADEX framework ( https://www.activecomponents.org/), a Java-based platform for development of multiagent systems. 
The self-healing capability equips the agents with the ability to sense and to act so that when the agents monitor the system and detect functional or performance-related issues they will carry out repair actions to get the system back to a desired level of functionality or performance. The agents also communicate with each other to coordinate their self-healing activities to avoid performing conflicting actions. 
This project is related to a research project with Swinburne University of technology.
